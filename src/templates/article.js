            We created a digital + physical + service product for improving
            hypertension control across populations. This is how clinicians use

            The strategy was to do this well at the individual healthcare
            facility level and then to scale it up to districts, states, all of
            India and other countries.

            We started the project with a design sprint, where we ideated,
            arrived at a concept, and prototyped and validated it with real
            clinicians in a week. Our team then designed an engineered a
            functional prototype Android app in the next 45 days. We took that
            prototype to the rural Punjab and tested it with real users. In just
            5 months, Simple had launched in 20 clinics and was recording real
            patient data in live clinical environments. Simple is now being used
            at healthcare facilties in urban clinics to primary healthcare
            centres in remote villages in India. Our work is already making a
            positive impact at the population level.

            Simple competes with and is quicker than the existing pen and paper
            system, even for first time smartphone users. Previously, clinicians
            spent a couple of minutes just to find each patient’s treatment card
            from a stack of hundreds, but now users only had to scan a QR code
            to look up their record.
