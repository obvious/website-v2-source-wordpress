        Saving Millions of Lives from Cardiovascular Disease

        We partnered with the Indian Hypertension Control Initiative (IHCI) on
        their mission to save 100 million lives from cardiovascular disease.

          We created a digital + physical + service product for improving
          hypertension control across populations. This is how clinicians use
          Simple:

        <ol className="font-serif text-sm">
          <li>
            Record patient blood pressures and medications over time to improve
            treatment.

          <li>Make sure patients keep getting their BP checked regularly.</li>
        </ol>

          The strategy was to do this well at the individual healthcare facility
          level and then to scale it up to districts, states, all of India and
          other countries.

          We started the project with a design sprint, where we ideated, arrived
          at a concept, and prototyped and validated it with real clinicians in
          a week. Our team then designed an engineered a functional prototype
          Android app in the next 45 days. We took that prototype to the rural
          Punjab and tested it with real users. In just 5 months, Simple had
          launched in 20 clinics and was recording real patient data in live
          clinical environments. Simple is now being used at healthcare
          facilties in urban clinics to primary healthcare centres in remote
          villages in India. Our work is already making a positive impact at the
          population level.

          Simple competes with and is quicker than the existing pen and paper
          system, even for first time smartphone users. Previously, clinicians
          spent a couple of minutes just to find each patient’s treatment card
          from a stack of hundreds, but now users only had to scan a QR code to
          look up their record.

          Nurses and doctors are using Simple everyday to save lives and are
          proud of their contributions to this large mission. They can now spend
          more time actually treating and counselling patients, rather than
          recording data.
